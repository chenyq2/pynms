Py**NMS** components are documented separately, and generally provide example code as well as usage documentation. Use the links in the main navigation menu to access each project's documentation.

A copy of the documentation is maintained under the docs/ directory of each GitHub repostory (albeit slightly differently formatted).

Py**NMS** components that create runnable projects will generally include a [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) setup in the `vagrant` subdirectory of the project. The `up.sh` script is intended to package the project and deploy it. The `tests` directory of each project can also act as an invaluable set of examples when working with the code!

If you find issues with the documentation - please report them (via [e-mail](mailto:rjs@rob.sh), and they'll be fixed ASAP! Contributions of new documentation, example code, packaging or other supporting material is most welcome.

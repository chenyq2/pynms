# PyNMS - a collection of libraries for Network Management in Python

[PyNMS](http://pynms.io) is a collection of libraries for network management in Python, biased towards model-driven network management, exploiting the [OpenConfig](http://openconfig.net) set of data models, and associated ecosystem.

## Projects

 * [**PyangBind**](https://github.com/robshakir/pyangbind) - a plugin for pyang to generate Python bindings for a YANG model.
 * [**PyNMS gRPC**](https://github.com/robshakir/pynms/tree/master/grpc) - an example implementation of a gRPC client/server which can be used to effect changes of **PyangBind** classes between two systems.
